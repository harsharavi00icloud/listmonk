# Internationalization (i18n)

listmonk comes available in multiple languages thanks to language packs contributed by volunteers. A language pack is a JSON file with a map of keys and corresponding translations. The bundled languages can be [viewed here](https://github.com/knadh/listmonk/tree/master/i18n).

## Additional language packs
These additional language packs can be downloaded and passed to listmonk with the `--i18n-dir` flag as described in the next section.

| Language         | Description                          |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| [Deutsch (formal)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SvenPe/listmonk/4bbb2e5ebb2314b754cb2318f4f6683a0f854d43/i18n/de.json) | German language with formal pronouns |


## Customizing languages

To customize an existing language or to load a new language, put one or more `.json` language files in a directory, and pass the directory path to listmonk with the<br />`--i18n-dir=/path/to/dir` flag.


## Contributing a new language

- Visit [https://listmonk.app/i18n](https://listmonk.app/i18n)
- To make changes to an existing language, use the "Load language" option on the top right.
- To create a new language, use the "Load language" option on the top right and select "Default".
- Translate the text in the input fields on the UI.
- Once done, use the `Switch to raw JSON` and copy the JSON data and save it to a file named `xx.json`, where `xx` is the two letter code of the language.
- Send a pull request to add the file to the [i18n directory on the GitHub repo](https://github.com/knadh/listmonk/tree/master/i18n). If you are not familiar with pull requests, share the file by creating a new "issue"  (comment) on the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/knadh/listmonk/issues)
