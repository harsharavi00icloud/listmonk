# Internationalization (i18n)

listmonk comes available in multiple languages thanks to language packs contributed by volunteers. A language pack is a JSON file with a map of keys and corresponding translations. The bundled languages can be [viewed here](https://github.com/knadh/listmonk/tree/master/i18n).

## Additional language packs
These additional language packs can be downloaded and passed to listmonk with the `--i18n-dir` flag as described in the next section.

| Language         | Description                          |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| [Deutsch (formal)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SvenPe/listmonk/4bbb2e5ebb2314b754cb2318f4f6683a0f854d43/i18n/de.json) | German language with formal pronouns |


## Customizing languages

To customize an existing language or to load a new language, put one or more `.json` language files in a directory, and pass the directory path to listmonk with the<br />`--i18n-dir=/path/to/dir` flag.

## Language contributions

- Go to https://inlang.com/editor/github.com/knadh/listmonk
- To make changes and push them, you need to log in to GitHub using OAuth and fork the project from the UI.
- Translate the text in the input fields on the UI. You can use the filters to see only the necessary translations.
- Once you're done, push the changes from the UI and click on "Open a pull request." This will take you to GitHub, where you can write a PR message.

Creating new languages from the editor will be possible soon.
